Install Rhino 7 on Ubuntu based OS (KDE on Jammy in this case)

âš **This assumes a non existant wine prefix or even a wine installation. If you have an existing wine prefix there may be things that interfere with this guide.**

* [ ] Start by installing wine and some required adjacent libraries. 

``sudo apt install wine wine32 winetricks mono-complete winbind``

``wineboot -u``

* [ ] install gecko browser for wine (required for license config to work)

``mkdir ~/.cache/wine``
``cd ~/.cache/wine``
``wget http://dl.winehq.org/wine/wine-gecko/2.47.2/wine-gecko-2.47.2-x86_64.msi``
``wget http://dl.winehq.org/wine/wine-gecko/2.47.2/wine-gecko-2.47.2-x86.msi``
``wineboot``

* [ ] various winetricks commands will log a lot of errors and warnings and yet still work. (Task Failed Successfuly?) so don't get too worried

``winetricks --force dotnet48``

* [ ] Click "restart now" lol
* [ ] kill all existing wine services so reg server doesn't get messed up.

``kill -9 $(ps aux |grep -i '\.exe' |awk '{print $2}'|tr '\n' ' ')``

* [ ] Install needed fonts. (personally, I think the missing fonts seems to kill Rhino on Wine the most)

``winetricks allfonts``

* [ ] A few more winetricks to install here.

``winetricks vulkanrt``
``winetricks dxvk``
``winetricks gdiplus``

* [ ] Force wine to appear as Windows 10

Sometimes this hangs, so control-c to break back to terminal prompt if necessary.

``wine winecfg -v win10``



The only libraries in Wine Configuration (winecfg) should be the following:

1. *gdiplus (native)

2. *mscoree (native)

**No other libraries should be present**

* [ ] Navigate to libraries and do the dirty work ðŸ”ª

``winecfg``

* [ ] Set renderer to no3d - although Rhino still uses gpu acceleration? this part is magic to me. âœ¨

``winetricks renderer=no3d``

* [ ] ðŸ”ª Kill all existing remaining wine processes. This can be done in any terminal in your current session. (bash/zsh)

`kill -9 $(ps aux |grep -i '\.exe' |awk '{print $2}'|tr '\n' ' ')`

* [ ] Download latest Rhino 7 installer and run it. (Filename might change here)

`wine ~/Downloads/rhino_en-us_7.24.22308.15001.exe`

* [ ] Installer will appear to exit, but it won't actually - it leaves the installer stub and main installer running.
* [ ] ðŸ”ª Kill all remaining wine processes again. Do this from another terminal window if it pleases you. (bash/zsh)

`kill -9 $(ps aux |grep -i '\.exe' |awk '{print $2}'|tr '\n' ' ')`

* [ ] A Rhino 7 shortcut should appear on your desktop, you can just use that link to start it after finishing this process.
* [ ] Change to installed Rhino directory and run rhino

``cd ~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Rhino 7/System``
``wine rhino.exe``

* [ ] First time running rhino.exe brings up the installer dialog (the one asking to reinstall or repair). I've tried this a few times and it's repeatable, so just close the dialog box with the upper right X. The web based license process will then proceed.
* [ ] Type your email in and log in via your regular web browser

The license service is listening on tcp:1717 for the authorization string - depending on your system configuration (firewall), the request url to authorize the license will be an http on loopback tcp:1717, so that traffic needs to be allowed.

* [ ] Answer/dismiss the usage tracking dialog
* [ ] Run Grasshopper from within Rhino and select any example document to start it.
* [ ] Grasshopper font mapper will announce that Segoe Print is not available. Confirm the suggested alternative, Tahoma
